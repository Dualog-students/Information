## Getting started
If you are familiar with some of the tools/technologies, that's great. If not, start skimming through the links under "general information".
Second, consider installing Windows 10 on your machine as Dualog is heavily connected to the .NET / Microsoft ecosystem. Having a decent Mac with VS Code and VS 2017 for Mac installed will get you far, too.

## Company guidelines
Some standards that we (try) to follow within the Organization. This is to keep the development process somewhat streamlined.

### Colors / Design
Stuff on mimer, link to color palette?

### Coding conventions
Coding conventions create a consistent look to the code, so that readers can focus on content, not layout. They enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience. They also facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.

To achieve this we are using an EditorConfig inside each project. [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

[See this link for .NET coding convention settings examples for editorconfigs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-code-style-settings-reference)



## Licensing
All the repositories made in the "Dualog-Students" organization starts as open-source and licensed project by project. Dualog can at any time decide to take an open-source project and close it from the public to either hide company secrets or for protecting customers. See https://choosealicense.com/ for open-source licensing examples.
